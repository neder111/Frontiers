# Deep learning approaches for Protecting IoT Devices in Smart Homes from MiTM Attacks
## Absctract
This paper presents an enhanced framework utilizing deep learning method as an Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) to identify Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. The primary objective is to safeguard IoT devices against eavesdropping., ensuring the maintenance of data integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. The framework aims to verify the authenticity of communication parties, uphold overall system and network security within Software-Defined Networking (SDN) environments, and establish trust among users and stakeholders. The experimental analysis focuses on machine learning algorithms, specifically those associated with Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) such as Naive Bayes (NB), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN),  Random Forest (RF), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The CNN algorithm exhibits superior performance on the training dataset, achieving an accuracy of 99.96\%, minimizing training time,  It also demonstrates favorable outcomes in terms of detection time, requiring only 1 second, and maintains a low false alarm rate (FAR) of 0.02\%. Subsequently, the proposed method was deployed on a testbed SDN framework to assess its detection performance across various network topologies. The results highlight its efficiency compared to other related works.
